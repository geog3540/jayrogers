         <p class="card-text">This map displays the flows of bananas in seven South American countries. The symbology of my total flow was quantiles with five classes. I chose quantiles because it divides the total number of features into approximately equal classes. Since the study area only contains 7 countries, there will be either one or two values in each class. The classes are evenly spaced as well. The nodes are on a proportional scale. I chose to display the nodes because they serve as a good visual aid to see the change between countries. Each node is also in the center of the country, making it easier to determine where the flows are going in and out of. The flows are curve half arrow and utilize the equal interval classification with 5 classes. I chose this because there is an even distribution of the flow values, and 5 classes can make it easier to see which countries had the most tons of flow.
Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay receive the most in-flows in South America. This is because they do not have the capacity to produce thousands of tons of bananas due to climate or spatial limitations. Ecuador has the highest outflow as well as total flow. They export bananas to every country in the study area and receive zero tons from other sources. Generally, the flow of bananas is from north to south because of the changing climate. Bananas grow in warm, humid weather near the equator, so it makes sense that the lower countries would need to import their bananas. As a larger country, Brazil has a higher export rate than a smaller country like Colombia. Brazil also has an expansive rainforest, perfect for growing bananas.
